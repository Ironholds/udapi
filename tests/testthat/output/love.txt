  Love is an incredibly powerful word. When you're in love, you always
  want to be together, and when you're not, you're thinking about being
  together because you need that person and without them your life is
  incomplete.

  This love is unconditional affection with no limits or conditions:
  completely loving someone. It's when you trust the other with your
  life and when you would do anything for each other. When you love
  someone you want nothing more than for them to be truly happy no
  matter what it takes because that's how much you care about them and
  because their needs come before your own. You hide nothing of
  yourself and can tell the other anything because you know they accept
  you just the way you are and vice versa.

  It's when they're the last thing you think about before you go to
  sleep and when they're the first thing you think of when you wake up,
  the feeling that warms your heart and leaves you overcome by a
  feeling of serenity. Love involves wanting to show your affection
  and/or devotion to each other. It's the smile on your face you get
  when you're thinking about them and miss them.

  Love can make you do anything and sacrifice for what will be better
  in the end. Love is intense,and passionate. Everything seems
  brighter, happier and more wonderful when you're in love. If you find
  it, don't let it go.
